# Project 4:  Brevet time calculator with Ajax

Reimplemented the RUSA ACP controle time calculator with flask and ajax

## Author: Anna Saltveit

## ACP controle times

That's "controle" with an 'e', because it's French, although "control"
is also accepted.  Controls are points where   
a rider must obtain proof of passage, and control[e] times are the
minimum and maximum times by which the rider must  
arrive at the location.    

## Testing

Includes nose tests.
